### Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of data from a personal activity monitoring device. The dataset spans two months, October and November 2012, and includes information about the number of steps taken in 5-minute intervals each day.

The primary objectives of the analysis include:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.
2. Investigation of daily step patterns, including the creation of histograms to visualize the total number of steps taken each day.
3. Calculation of daily mean and median steps.
4. Time series analysis to observe trends in the average number of steps taken.
5. Identification of the 5-minute interval with the highest average number of steps.
6. Handling missing data through imputation strategies.
7. Comparison of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends.

The analysis will be conducted using R and R Markdown, providing a reproducible and well-documented workflow.

### Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following variables:

- `steps`: Number of steps taken in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as NA).
- `date`: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format.
- `interval`: Identifier for the 5-minute interval.

### Getting Started
To begin the analysis, follow the steps below:

1. Load the necessary libraries.
2. Read in the dataset.
3. Explore the structure of the data.
4. Check for missing values.
